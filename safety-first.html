      <h2>All the administration and safety concerns dealt with</h2>
      <h3>ID Tags and Collars</h3>
      <p>Firstly, please ensure that you have a tag made with your contact details on as soon as possible. Do NOT put the dog's name on the tag. Dog identity tags come in all shaopes and sizes, and can be readily purchased within the UK - every dog should have one.</p>

      <p>In the UK, the Control of Dogs Order 1992 states that any dog in a public place must wear a collar with the <strong>name and address (including postcode) of the owner</strong> engraved or written on it or engraved on a tag. Your telephone number is optional (but we would recommend this). You can be fined up to £5,000 if your dog does not wear an identification tag. You do not have to put your dog's name on the tag, this is optional. Unfortunately, dog theft is a real danger and if the thief knows the name of your dog this may help them pass on the dog to the unsuspecting new owners because it appears they know the dog because the dog responds to their name. We would therefore recommend that you do not put your dog's name on the tag.</p>

      <p>When your dog arrives in the UK, they cannot leave their home address for 48 hours (in line with DEFRA regulations). This gives your dog two days to stay in your home (without exploring the wider world) so that they can rest and properly decompress. This only applies to new arrivals in the UK and not for second chance adoptions from the UK. If you do not have a garden this of course will be an exception, and you can contact us for guidance on this.</p>

      <p>You will have paid for a recycled/new collar and identity disc with your rescuers contact details on. This ID tag must be kept on your rescue dog until the microchip is registered in your name after the settling in period/subject to the contract being satisfied. The settling in period in terms of registration is considered to be three months. You can put the disc on your own harness or collar.</p>

      <p>The collar we send is just to carry the disc to you and is not designed to be your security during walking/garden visits (if you wish to donate the collar & tag back to us, we would be most grateful. You can do this within the UK for your convenience, please ask for the UK address to it send to).</p>

      <p>Both your ID disc and the rescuers must be attached to the dog at all times when they have access to your garden or on walks. When the dog is settled, providing your garden is 100% secure, you can take the collar off during relaxation periods.</p>

      <h3>Microchips & Registration</h3>
      <p>Your dog will be microchipped, and this will be registered to us (if you are foster family/back-up please ask your rescuer for the guidelines on fostering).</p>

      <p>To start the registration process you must request the transfer from us (we will not do it automatically). Alternatively request it directly from the database 'Animal tracker' by logging onto the pet microchip database or call them on the number provided below. Authorisation if applicable may take a few days so allow time for this.</p>

      <em>For E.U. Adoptions you must comply with the dog laws set out by your country of residence.</em>

      <p>Animal Tracker Telephone Number: 01279 219777</p>

      <p>Website: <a href="https://www.animaltracker.co.uk/direct/">animaltracker.co.uk</a></p>

      <p>Animal Tracker offer all kinds of benefits and services to their customers especially those that have chosen a rescue, such as a lifetime of as many updates to your registration as you like, for example, a change of telephone  number/address and they also do engraved identity tags at only £9.99 for two - price correct at time of writing. Be sure to mention that you adopted from Break the Chains for Dogs Bulgaria and ask them about their varying offers.</p>

      <p><strong>MOST IMPORTANTLY INVEST IN A GPS TRACKER:</strong> the ones that are recommended by experienced trackers are:</p>

      <p><strong>BE SAFE NOT SORRY.</strong></p>

      <p>In my experience there are two common reasons a dog would choose to escape:</p>

      <h4>Instinct/Nature:</h4>
      <p>this is what drives dogs abandoned to the street and is the gut feeling they rely on for survival. All they have ever known is the golden rule of not ending up in a closed-in area. This is for obvious reasons such as when searching for food in public places like café seating areas they would often be chased away or threatened with sticks and stones, or the memory of when they were caught by dog catchers. Containment equals danger and this is worth remembering when your rescue dog is reluctant to go into new rooms or through doorways.</p>

      <h4>Lack of Exercise Routine:</h4> 
      <p>What I mean by this is dogs that have not regularly been walked often are not used to a walking routine. This is often the case for dogs that have been in public/government shelters where there are not enough staff, or when dogs, who have never been lead trained, panic when on the end of a lead (see above re: containment/restraint).</p>

      <h3>Flight Risk</h3>
      <h4>Why would my dog want to escape and what should I do to help prevent it?</h4>

      <p>Many of the dogs have also been 'chain' dogs on metal & wire which has traumatized them. When this happens the dog(s) often become so excited to be able to burn off some energy, or conversely so panicked at being restrained, that they take the chance to back up out of collars or harnesses and run away. Of course, they don't realize the implication of this, such as becoming lost in a strange place and safety issues around cars/traffic/railways etc.</p>

      <p>Below are some tips which may help you not only prevent a dog escaping, but also slowly start to prevent the dog wanting to in the first place.</p>
      
      <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-dog"></i> Tip 1 - Safety first: secure the home.</h4>
      <p>When in the house always keep in mind that your dog is fast, and it only takes a second to escape. The front door should ALWAYS be locked if you are expecting visitors. You could have family and friends who are free to enter your homes without knocking. However, they will not always remember and could walk in and before you know it your dog is gone. By locking the front door this prevents this accident. Use 'Close the door/gate' signs. It may be, for example, that for 30+ years you have not had to worry about closing side gates or front doors if nipping to the car and chances are you might still forget despite your best efforts. By having a sign on the door or gate it's just a gentle reminder.</p>

      <p>><em>Triple check - check, check and check again.</em> 
        <ul>
          <li>Are you sure you closed the side gate before you to take your dog outside to use toilet?</li> 
          <li>Did the door fully close and is not slightly open?</li> 
          <li>Did the children leave the gate ajar when going out to play?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-dog"></i> Tip 2 - Find your dog a friend to learn from.</h4>
      <p>If you or a friend already have a friendly dog who is not a flight-risk, then this can help for a number of reasons. Firstly, as dogs are pack animals, they like to be around each other which can sometimes help to be a calming influence on a dog who thinks they need to escape. Secondly, they can learn lessons by observing a dog who does not try to run every time a door is open; they basically look to them to learn how to behave in the given environment.</p>

      <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-dog"></i> Tip 3 - Safety when out on a walk.</h4>
      <p>To help ensure your dog does not escape when on a walk follow these guidelines:</p>

      <p><ul>
      <li>Always use a collar which is securely fitted. It needs to be tight enough so that it cannot slip over your dog's head. Try and pull the collar over your dog's head, it should not come off. Don't feel bad about having a more tightly fitting collar, it's necessary and as long as it is not hurting your dog's breathing it will cause no harm. Make sure you can get two fingers between their neck and the collar, so you know it's not too tight.</li>
      
      <li>Use a 'two-point contact' system which means if one form of connection to your dog fails, the other is your back up. Ideally, use a specifically designed two-point contact leash (or two separate leads) with one end connected to the harness and the other end connected to the collar. Two leads and two collars is another option.</li>

      <li>Consider utilising a metal lead (not chain) if your dog shows any signs of snapping at leads, harnesses or collars. A dog in panic mode can easily chew through a lead in a second, so please do be vigilant. This is only in extreme cases which your rescuer will let you know about in advance.</li>

      <li>Remember your pooch can get bored, have the desire to explore, or the in-built desire to chase prey, and may not yet trust you enough to stay. They may not find their way back to you as they do not know the area. They can also head to train tracks and railways away from people to mimic the lonely tracks here.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>Please be mindful at all times of flight risk as you might with your own children.</p>

      <h3>Transport /Owners Private Group</h3>
      <h4>Why 'Whippee Wheels'?</h4>

      <p>Break The Chains for Dogs Bulgaria (BTC) wanted to find words to describe the happiness of them leaving Bulgaria to go on a journey to their new homes and happy it is. The private messenger group has been set up so that you can all correspond if you wish to, ask questions and stay updated with the courier's journey where possible.</p>

      <p>We ask that you remain respectful to one another, and address any sensitive issues to a group member privately. The group is optional, and you are not under any obligation to stay or join. However, please make alternative arrangements independently for support and updates if you decide to leave.</p>

      <p>It's important to note that depending on the transport available to me the information below can differ slightly as each service does things individually according to numbers travelling etc. This is a guideline only. As well as the general owners club <em>Whippee Wheels (WW)</em>, a secondary group <em>(SG)</em> that is specific to the current dogs travelling and their adopters (for single use only) may open around the French border if not earlier.</p>

      <p>Sometimes they are delivering around Europe so focus on that part of the journey first. You'll likely receive an ETA in the SG, listing your dog's name, postcode, which transport they are on (north, south etc.) and the time/date they'll arrive. Remember this is not a dental appointment. It's impossible for these complex logistics to be sent too far in advance or to fit in with your schedules, sorry. The geographical enormity of it determines how they do things and the welfare of the animals. It is out of my control. They are likely to be delivering other dogs not just yours.</p> 

      <p>Your invite to WW is usually sent the day before transport. Your transport date is when they depart not arrive. The trip normally takes 2-3 days. In order to receive updates, you'll need to be on social media.</p>

      <p>Either WhatsApp or Facebook messenger/private groups are the usual communication platforms used by transport. Please ask which is applicable because the choice of platform is usually decided by the transport.</p>

      <p>If you aren't on either of these platforms, then you will need to enlist a friend, neighbour or family member to join the transporters choice of platform on your behalf. You'll have to make sure that either you or they have added myself (Leesa McKenna) to Facebook as a friend or to WhatsApp. I cannot invite you to FB platforms unless we are 'connected' as friends. You'll find me quickly on my rescue page, or ask for my personal timeline link (this is NOT Break The Chains).</p>

      <p>Be sure to let me know the name you use on Facebook if it's not your legal name or the person you've nominated in your place. Let me know that you've put in a request. I get extremely busy and will not be able to deal with this on the day before transport so be prepared. You'll have my number from our telephone call. Ask if you need these details resending or if you have any questions.</p>
      
      <p><strong>It is your responsibility to make sure that you have done these things well in advance of your transport date and fully understand what's involved.</strong></p>

      <p>It may sound detailed but as it unfolds you'll realise how straightforward it is and what a huge trip it is for them.</p>

      <p>The journey is a big one for man and dog alike with a lot of logistics involved so we also ask that you work in with your courier for the drop off date and time. The dogs want to be off the van as soon as possible on the home stretch. Your transporters names can vary and are always an independent professional service which loves dogs and ensures a safe delivery. As they are the owners of their own courier business, I reiterate that I have no authority over arrival planning. I will only know the leaving date and approximate journey length subject to extenuating circumstances.</p>

      <p>We ask you politely to wait for driver updates rather than request them. They will be posted in good time. There are usually 2-3 drivers per vehicle, and they would greatly appreciate a gratuity which can be in Sterling currency and/or a goody bag for the trip.</p>

      <p>Remember that the transporters, in the interests of your dog's wellbeing and all on board, will not stop until each dog is safely delivered (subject to mitigating circumstances). To this end they may also drop-off through the night/early hours. It is advised to book time off work, which with the information provided here should be possible subject to your working circumstances.</p>

      <p>We cannot, of course, guarantee specific arrival times so if you can organise a couple of days either side of, or have a dog sitter available it's advisable. You'll also hear from the transporter directly, when he is in reach of your home so please have your phones handy at all times to help them out.</p>

      <p>I've uploaded a picture of their lovely van as my Whippee Wheels profile image. You're welcome to check in and interact. You can see a selection of images of one of the transporters below.</p>

        <img src="./images/couriers (2).jpg" alt="">
      </div>

      <p>Thank You For Your Time.</p>

      <p>The secondary group that includes the drivers is observational for them to ask questions. not us. They must focus on the welfare of the animals and safe driving. Please do not bombard them with questions - sorry but they must concentrate.</p>
      
     <p><strong>WE DO NOT POST DRIVING LICENSE PLATES/ VAN LOGOS OR LEAVING DATES PUBLICLY.</strong></p>

      <p>There are people who try to cause trouble for dogs and we act on the side of caution. Once they are on British soil we can relax. We're happy to hear your feedback, reviews and recommendations on my service and your adoptions once your new charges are dropped off and you're welcome to post those straight to my rescue campaign group (Break The Chains - For Dogs Bulgaria) and in the private owner's transport group in messenger (WW); and of course we always like to hear updates on how the dogs are getting on.</p>
