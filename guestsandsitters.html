Adopting a dog is very exciting and inevitably people will want to visit and meet your new family member.

Ideally people should wait until the dog settles before visiting. If they visit not long after your rescue has arrived please ensure they do not fuss or smother the dog.

Ask all visitors to sit quietly, talk gently and make no sudden movements. They should never force themselves on your new rescue. Allow the dog to get used to the visitor and when they are comfortable they will initiate any contact themselves. If that happens then advise your guests on the best way to touch / pet your dog (see "Handling" above).

A good rule is that if your dog wants to be fussed over or to meet people then they will come and say hello in their own time and on their terms.
