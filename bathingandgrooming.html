    <h1>Bathing and Grooming</h1>

    <!-- EDITABLE CONTENT: Replace or extend the HTML inside the #main-content div. -->
    <div id="main-content">

    <p>There is a natural temptation to want to bath your dog with the best of intentions. Some dogs may benefit from this happening sooner, the effects can be calming & help them to relax.</p>

    <p>The dirt and grime of their life in a shelter/pound, where bathing and/or grooming will have been infrequent, if possible at all, can result in itching, scratching and sadly a bit of a pong. A wash will therefore be a great way to eradicate this discomfort for them and the unpleasant smells of their journey and previous life.</p>

    <p>You would, of course, be advised not to do this within hours of your dog arriving, and each dog should be assessed individually. Obviously we don't expect you to cope with a pong or mess, so there are exceptions. Please ask us if you aren't sure.</p>

    <p>If your rescue dog is clearly under stress do not bath them - it will not help you bond; it will not be an enjoyable experience for your dog. Bathing could cause your dog lots of additional strain and could make them fear you more.</p>
    
    <p>Please always wait at least one week (or longer) in this instance, go at the pace of your dog. When you do wash them, a lukewarm shower, with you in it alongside them (gentle spray not power setting), or a bath with shallow water is best.</p>

    <p>A groomer straight away could cause too much stress. If in doubt, ask the welfare.</p>
