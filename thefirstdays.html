    When your dog arrives in the UK, they cannot leave their home address for 48 hours (in line with DEFRA regulations). This gives your dog two days to stay in your home (without exploring the wider world) so that they can rest and properly decompress.

    <strong>This only applies to new arrivals in the UK and not for second chance adoptions from the UK.</strong>

    During the first few days of decompression they'll need to rest and process what is going on. They need the time to sleep, but the body is still dealing with the journey, new environment, new people and noises etc. That first deep sleep of a rescue dog is wonderful. The pure sighs of relief and release. And the fact that they feel safe enough to do so, is so huge step forward.

    Make sure you don't have visitors for the first few days. Wait until your dog is ready. Even though it's exciting, they need time to get used to you, routine, new things and it's a lot to take in. Take each step at the dog's pace. It doesn't matter if they don't go out for a walk. As long as they're safe and they're needs are met.

    Use your first few days/weeks/months to help them to feel safe and secure, learn about new things; some might never have seen a dog toy for example! Don't force them into situations they're not comfortable in, especially around children, or large groups. If you don't want to be around people, ask them to leave your dog alone.

    You and your dog is what is important here, your bond is the greatest you will ever achieve. Take the time to learn about each other and you'll have the greatest dog in the world.

    Patience, understanding, and positive reinforcement are key to building trust and helping your rescue dog overcome their fears. Let them adjust at their own pace, reward them for good behaviour, and most importantly, show them that their new home is a place of safety and love.

    The following advice applies to dogs who are taking a little longer to adapt than others may:

    Please do not try to force them out of their safe zones before they are ready.

    Do not take their choices away because that is what you want.

    They will come to you when they wish to.

    You can offer them food by all means but do not be disappointed if they do not take it. This is not a rejection it is just a very natural state of uncertainty.
    Talk to them with gentle tones as you pass or sit close by. Tell them how brave and good and beautiful they are.

    Go down to their level & see if they will let you stoke them under their chin (trying to stoke them on their head first can remind them of being hit & scare them).

    It is not important if your dog does not wish to walk outside within the first week. They need to trust you before they walk with you. Again imagine for a moment that you are learning to dance on a new dance floor. Before you let anyone lead you by the hand or lift you up in the air, you need to find your feet and trust your partner.

    Try to put yourself in their paws – how would you feel in the position your new rescue dog is in?
