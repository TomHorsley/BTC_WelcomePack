    <h1>Veterinary Information</h1>

    <!-- EDITABLE CONTENT: Replace or extend the HTML inside the #main-content div. -->
    <div id="main-content">

      <p>Please note we comply to all regulations and go above our obligations regarding APHA (U.K. government) requirements.</p>

      <p>We only have to do tape worm and rabies along with a HC (health certificate), though we also vaccinate, give flea, worming and tick treatments, and blood tests for tick-borne infections, leishmania, dirofilaria and other non contagious ailments (unless a vet does not consider a specific test necessary in their professional opinion). In addition we test for brucellosis. This is performed with the same eliza technology as the PCR tests.</p>

      <p>We don’t ask you to cover the costs of these optional tests. As a small welfare we fund this service. We are a responsible in our rehoming protocols. Additionally, we will give you the choice to opt for a PCR test for antigens too, the cost of which would be covered by yourselves and are a lot more reasonable than a U.K. clinic would charge you.</p>

      <p>Most U.K. vets are very happy with our practices. Be aware that non discriminatory vets will welcome you and your pet and will put their welfare above profit margin or bias.</p>

      <p>Unless a vet states that a dog cannot be neutered / castrated on the grounds of it being a risk to their well-being then our rescues will NOT travel intact.</p>

      <h3>Cats:</h3>
      <p>Same applies as for dogs re: castrations/ spaying.</p>
      <p>They will have flea, tick and worming prior to leaving. They will have the rabies vaccine and in addition to this:
        <ul>
          <li>Feligen RCP, or similar brand, for the active immunisation of healthy cats against three core feline diseases: feline panleucopaenia, feline rhinotracheitis, and feline calicivirus.</li>
          <li>A "fu felv snap test" to screen cats for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>These tests provide rapid, reference-lab quality results within minutes at the point of care, making them efficient for routine health checks and identifying these serious retroviral infections in cats.</p>

      <p><em>The rescues travel with passports/microchips, and in some cases additional paperwork etc.</em></p>
