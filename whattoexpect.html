   Introducing a rescue dog into your home is like welcoming a new room-mate who's been living out of a suitcase for the past decade – they're probably a bit confused and disoriented. Some dogs will settle in like a seasoned jet-setter, while others may need a little more time to decompress.

If your dog is safe and happy, that should be the key ingredient here. We as humans all to often put too much pressure on our dogs to 'fit in' to our lives. These dogs have been through a lot in comparison to your normal household pet; they've seen and dealt with trauma like no other UK dog. Their key socialisation period was probably spent on the streets, learning how to bin raid and not get caught by dog catchers, watching dogs get caught and trapped,on a chain and/or in the pound for the duration of their lives. All this builds on the dog they are today, and we need to remember that when we're expecting them to fit into our lives.

Patience and understanding are key, as is establishing a predictable routine. Don't be surprised if there's some collateral damage along the way – accidents, chewed furniture, and general mayhem are all part of the aftercare package. Just roll with it, shower them with love, and eventually, they'll start to feel right at home.

Remember, every rescue dog is an individual, and each one requires time and patience to settle into their new environment.

Here are some key points to keep in mind:

Patience is a virtue: Every dog has their own pace, so don't expect an instant transformation. Some dogs may take weeks or even months to fully adjust to their new surroundings. They don't come with a set timetable.
Routine is key: Dogs thrive on predictability. Establish regular feeding times, walk times, and bedtime rituals to provide a sense of security and stability.
Expect mishaps: Accidents, chewing incidents, and general mayhem are all part of the package. Be prepared to roll with the punches and approach these situations with patience and understanding. Remember there is no point in “telling your dog off” if the behaviour has already happened, they won’t relate it to the “bad” thing they did but to what is happening when you tell them off – you will only confuse them.
Shower them with love: Positive reinforcement works wonders with dogs. Reward them with treats, praise, and belly rubs for good behaviour to build trust, confidence and strengthen your bond - but don't smother them.
Seek help when needed: If you're struggling, don't hesitate to reach out for guidance and support. Remember, you're not alone in this journey and it's much better to seek support sooner rather than later.
What works for one dog may not work for another, and the initial adjustment period can be a roller-coaster of emotions for both the dog and its new guardians. Think about everything they've been through so far in their lives and then add in the new routine, house, people, noises and all the things they're learning. Give them time to process, rest and relax.

Your bonding time is important, giving them what they need and their welfare needs is far more valuable than being able to take them out for a 10 mile walk with friends and family.

It's crucial to remember that many dogs who are rejected early in their adoption journey never had the chance to fully relax and be themselves in their new home. This is often due to a lack of emotional preparation on the part of the human family. Sleep deprivation, messes, and stress can take a toll on both the mind and body, a stark reminder that dog rescue is as much about the human aspect as it is about the dogs themselves.

When welcoming a rescue dog into your life, it's essential to have realistic expectations, especially if the dog is exhibiting signs of fear or trauma.
