    <h2>Safe Zones</h2>
    <p>Dogs, and in particular ones with a difficult, abusive past and who have just experienced a long journey, may need to find and establish “safe zones”. During the first few days of decompression, they'll need somewhere they feel safe safe to rest and process what is going on.</p>

    <p>Having a "special place" like a den of some sort is brilliant, but it all comes down to what the dog feels comfortable with. For instance, Rapunzel, one of our owner's dogs, sits under his desk if she is feeling anxious. She has decided that under the desk is her safe place, and it is where she will always head to if there is something causing her anxiety, like thunder or fireworks.</p>

    <p>Crate training is popular in the U.K., sadly metal cages are the most common kind of crates used. </p>

    <p>Please read our section on why we prohibit the use of crates and cages, or contact us to learn why they are not needed (with <strong>rare</strong> exceptions), how they can cause injuries to your dogs and some safe alternatives. However, the best way is their way because they know better than we do what safe means to them and where to find it. Just because we think they feel a certain way doesn't mean <strong>they</strong> do.</p>

    <p>Most dogs will have a few favourite spaces around the house. This could be their bed or crate, their favourite spot on the sofa, or the room they like most. Turn your dog's favourite spot into their designated safe space. You could add a comfy bed or blankets to their favourite nook, perhaps by the side of the sofa or under a certain table, to make it a safe and snug haven for them.</p>

    <p>If your dog doesn't have a favourite spot already, choose somewhere in a room your dog normally spends time in, where they naturally like to rest. Make a cosy den for them and build up positive associations with the space.</p>

  
    <p>Make sure all family members, especially children, know where your dog's den is, and to leave them alone when they're in it. Ask visitors not to disturb your dog when they're in this spot.</p>
