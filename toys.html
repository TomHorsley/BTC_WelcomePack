    <div id="main-content">

<p>Very often these dogs do not know how to play. Throw a ball and they may think you are throwing it at them. So gentle encouragement with cloth type toys is better.</p>

<p>Use a firm & gentle 'no' if they take your belongings such as slippers and then immediately hand them one of their toys so they can understand what is yours and what is theirs. Praise them for turning their attentions to the toy.</p>

<p>Be aware that an item like a ball/toy can be similar to a high-value treat (prized-possession) so it may be sensible to introduce them slowly rather than immediately.</p>

<p><strong>They don't always want to share - through no fault of their own.</strong></p>
