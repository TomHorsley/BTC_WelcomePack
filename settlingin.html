      <h3>Walking</h3>
      When you feel that the relationship is progressing then you can consider taking your dog for a walk. We advise using a harness as some rescue dogs are chain dogs and collars can upset them initially until they know that they will not be chained up again. Equally we do not recommend chain collars or chain leads for the same reason. These should be avoided. Choke collars, prong collars and e-collars are also not acceptable. Many dogs who have had bad experiences like this will walk in the UK on day 2 with no training so we should never assume their past will define them.

      However, harnesses give you a more gentle and secure method of walking your rescue dog, so they are worth investing in. We recommend the affordable non-slip/no-pull harness featured below by Truelove.

      Other brands such as RUFFWEAR and HEALING PAWZ also proved very good options.

      Harnesses are great safety measures if a sudden noise startles them. They cannot slip out of them easily and you have more control. We can send height measurements, and sometimes weight, however you'll have an opportunity to measure your dog on arrival and make your purchase prior to walking. As harnesses are adjustable, we can guide you in advance on the right Truelove harness size to buy.

      <em>(Please be sure to have the right sized harness, and that it is adjusted properly, or they will find a way to wriggle out of it).</em>

      Always employ '2 point contact' which literally means 2 points of hold, so if one fails you can rely on the backup contact. There are many options available in the high street stores and on the internet. A good idea would be a double ended training lead with one end fastened to the harness and the other end fastened to the collar. Remember just because your rescue seems safe on a collar and lead does not mean they will be if there is a sudden noise that frightens them.

      <strong>BE SAFE NOT SORRY!</strong>

      A suitable double countact lead is shown below:


      High value treats (cheese, hot dogs, burger bits, cooked chicken) are good for recall on walks, on the lead or when they toilet outside. It is vital to reward them them (always have a treat bag handy).

      It is okay if you both go outside and do not get very far, or even if you just sit on a bench and keep each other company.

      It is fine if you do not go for walks for the first few days it is preferable not to in some circumstances. Let the dog get used to people in the house first. They need to be curious about going out and not frightened or apprehensive. They can feel safe and free in your garden. Curiosity will come after they have adjusted to your home. You will know the right time.

      Your rescue also needs the opportunity to exercise and run off lead and you are contracted to take them to enclosed parks and training grounds purpose built for that activity until you have trained them in recall. This is essential for their emotional and physical welfare. By following our advice your rescue no matter how timid will be going for walks within weeks usually. We state this from experience.

      Keep our ID tag on your harness or collar along with the one you purchase with your details on. Do not remove the collar unless you are absolutely sure your garden is secure and always make sure it accompanies your dog on walks. There is never a reason for your dog not to benefit from going for walks if you follow our advice and approach things in the right way. The most shut down and scared dogs have walked before they've even been stroked with an owner who is following guidelines.

      Only when your dog is settled and happy with short walks should you consider longer walks. 

      When your dog is ready for longer walks consider using a long line, which will provide them with more freedom, but will still allow you some control. But be careful as it is easy for you, your dog and other dogs you might meet to get tangled up if you are not concentrating completely on walking your dog.

      Allow your dog time to sniff and rummage about, they are finding there way in the world, and allowing them to sniff is a great way to help to build a calm and confident dog.
