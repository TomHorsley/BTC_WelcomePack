The temptation to smother your new arrival with affection is understandably high. However, as humans, we often use touch and eye contact to convey comfort and trust, which can have the opposite effect on a scared or traumatized dog.

It is incredibly important to learn canine body language (see the Training Tips section), your dog communicates to you through their body language, and if you don’t pick up on their subtle messages you could end up with both of you being frustrated and potentially becoming anxious with each other. We often hear owners complaining that their dogs don’t listen to them, but do we really listen to our dogs, and understand what they need from the partnership?

To a dog, physical contact can be misinterpreted as a threat, especially from unfamiliar humans. Instead of reaching out to pet or hug them, give them the space they need to feel safe and secure. Try not to “loom” over your rescue dog, or suddenly touch them from behind, but get down to their level and let them approach you on their terms, and allow them to sniff your hand before attempting to stroke them – and try not to make any sudden moves. If the dog looks uncomfortable, move away – don’t force yourself on them.

Similarly, direct eye contact can be seen as an aggressive gesture in the canine world. Instead of staring them down, glance away periodically to signal your non-threatening intentions.

The best way to help a scared rescue dog settle in is to provide them with a predictable and consistent routine. This includes regular feeding times, toilet breaks, and quiet time for rest and relaxation.
