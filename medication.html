      <p>All the dogs have blood tests, non-obligatory for import, and are vaccinated and treated for worms, ticks and fleas before they are adopted. However, sometimes there is a necessity/precaution to send medication, such as additional antibiotics, which can be perfectly normal for dogs of all walks of life. A state vet stamps a certificate that they can travel. Sometimes your dog will arrive with the remainder of some medication to take.</p>

      <p>If any medication arrives with your dog this will have been fully communicated to you prior to arrival and arranged with your consent.</p>

      <p>Remember these are dogs that, prior to being rescued, have never been to a veterinary clinic. We do this not because import regulations require us to, but because we go above and beyond in the interests of both owner & dog. You may be sent a general guidance on this if necessary.</p>
