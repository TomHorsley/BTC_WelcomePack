   The journey can be traumatic especially when they are leaving the familiarity of what they have known. We all know that your home is better for them than what they have been used to but at this stage they do not know this. They do not know you. They do not know where they are. They will sense that you are not going to hurt them though this will not take away the fears that they may be feeling.

Put yourself in their paws. Ask yourself how you would feel if you were put in a van, ‘kidnapped’ off the street, ‘manhandled’ into a cage, taken to a place that you did not know, realize that you’re going to be OK, then you are taken somewhere else & no-one can communicate with you to tell you it’s going to be ‘OK’. It is the equivalent to being taken to planet mars, surrounded by Martians & then they all gather round you to dress & touch you before leading you around on a leash. You may well be petrified, shut down and non-responsive. The dog does not know that you are going to be consistently kind and constantly present in their lives and it may take time for them to trust understand and enjoy your company and their new home.

Slip Lead
Please make sure that you purchase and have available a slip lead like the one shown. The transport have their own though they must ensure that when they are taking the rescue safely into your property that they are using the one you have supplied so that they can leave this with you. 


Whilst the continued safety of your animal is not reliant upon a slip lead alone the dogs are used to these during transfers to vetinary clinics, on to the vehicle, etc. and this will be the most convenient & secure method for the driver to complete his service on arrival.

Do not walk your dog for 48hrs while they decompress and take them via the slip lead straight into your garden on arrival to relieve themselves off transport.

Identity Tags
Please ensure that you have an identity tag with your details to put straight on to your dog upon arrival. BTC will happily transfer microchips to the adopter when they can verify with a photograph that they have acquired their own disc. 

Please do not rely solely on the welfare’s which puts your dog at risk. Ours is for transport and emergencies in the U.K. in the event that a third party cannot get in touch with the owner
