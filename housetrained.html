    <h2>Dispelling The Myths</h2>

    <h3>A word from the rescuer:</h3>

    <p>I understand why people ask this and many of the natural fallacy's surrounding rescue dogs. Most Bulgarians believe that we are somewhat unsavoury for having dogs in our homes.</p>

    <p>It is a myth that homeless dogs aren't going to be adjusted to our lives and homes. It's because they've only ever gone outside that they don't like to go inside. They are creatures of habit and familiarity. It's because they've been tragically abandoned that they only know how to toilet outdoors. They do this without training, after-all if it was with training who would be doing it? Their 'owners', if they had any, neglected them and they were never allowed inside. The opportunity to 'house train' even if applicable would rarely have presented itself prior to rescue or within the rescue centres either U.K. or EU based. Which is why we find families for them, so that you can bring them that experience. Your input, therefore, on your dog's house-proud understandings only need to be a minimum at the most.</p>

    <p>A realistic view is that they aren't house trained. They automatically go outside away from where they sleep and eat, so don't need to be trained and that is less commonly known. They just need to understand what a door is and that it is operated and leads to the exit/garden. They can pick this up in less than thirty minutes sometimes, although it may take a couple of days so it's recommended to leave your door open to a <strong>secure</strong> outside space and that you accompany the rescue dog outside to watch over them.</p> 

    <p>Of course, praise them when they do go outdoors (positive affirmations) and vocalising their exit with low, strong 'commands' of approval, as though it were your idea: 'go for a wee wee good girl'.</p>

    <p>Any rescue dog from any country, including U.K., or even pedigrees sometimes can have accidents or no experience of a house.</p>
    
    <p>They can, of course, arrive stressed after a journey and wee indoors. It doesn't mean that they will always have these issues or nuances. It's not because of their past. It's the normal transition and they just need the gift of time.</p> 
    
    <p>Habits can develop that are environmentally triggered, and then they may re-use an area that they previously went in inside. Surgical spirit is the only product that removes any odours to a dogs sense of smell so it is always worth having a bottle. Certainly any habits or problems that arise can be 'nipped in the bud'. Often dogs think they are doing the
    right thing and it's confusing for them. We mean well, and don't realise we are reinforcing a behaviour rather than discouraging it. For example, one owner didn't take his dog outside immediately on arrival and when she went on a puppy training mat he had laid down he praised her so much that she thought that was what she was always meant to do. She has learnt the right place now!</p>

    <p><strong>Never</strong> shout at a dog if they do something that's unacceptable to you, and in no circumstances rub their noses in the accident. These old fashioned approaches are known to be unkind and ineffective. They will make your dogs anxious and compound any behaviour not resolve it. 'Training' such as rewarding and positive affirmation mentioned earlier when they wee in your garden, for example, should be introduced by the owner as part of responsible dog ownership.</p>

    <p>What I will say, is that when owners have followed our guidelines of going straight into a garden, we've never had a toilet issue in the three hundred dogs I've homed in the last year.</p>

    <p>I'll give you one brief example that will make you smile.</p>
    <p>Burton was fifteen years old when I met him. He had been ten years on a chain and five years in a government pound linving on concrete and outdoors. I found him a young glamorous family with children, and on the first day of arriving he went to the door to be let out for a wee.</p>
    <p>How did he know?</p>
    <p>He'd never lived in a house!</p>

    <p>They are phenomenal and miracle dogs. They are not feral but grateful and clever.</p>

    <p>A rescue centre commented to an adopter they sent to me that none of their U.K. rescues - interbred etc- could be homed straight to a house and she recommended our welfare.</p>

    <p><em>Remember</em> spread the word that these dogs have only ever gone outside; it's what they know and they will seek that familiarity out, as long as owners follow my guidances. Of course, there are exceptions as mentioned above. Sadly the instinct and compulsion to toilet outside can be interrupted by owners and the transport journey. Just as we can find ourselves out of our toilet routine when we travel abroad on holiday.</p> 
    <p><em>We can get them back on track of course.</em></p> 
    <p><strong>Be kind, be understanding and be compassionate.</strong></p>
