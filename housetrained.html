<h2>Dispelling The Myths</h2>
<p>It is a myth that 'street' dogs aren't going to be adjusted to our homes. It's because they have only ever gone outside that they don't like to go inside. They are creatures of habit and familiarity. It's because they've been tragically homeless that they only know how to toilet outdoors. They do this without training, after-all if it was with training who would be doing it? Their 'owners', even if they had any, neglected them and they were never allowed inside.</p>

<p>The opportunity to 'house train', even if applicable, would rarely have presented itself prior to rescue or within the rescue centres either U.K. or EU based . Which is why we find families for them so that you can bring them that experience - a home!</p>

<p>The input & guidance you need to give to this subject matter only needs to be minimum if at all in most cases.</p>

<p>Remember take them straight outside on arrival and leave your back door open so they can access the outside space in-line with the 'GARDEN' section of your welcome pack. You can download the PDF version of the pack & print it off for easy referencing. </p>

<p>A realistic expectation is that they aren't house trained. A surprising fact is that they shouldn't need to be. Of course praising them when they do go outside (positive reinforcement) is a good idea too. (See the Training section).</p>

<p>Any rescue dog from any country including U.K. or even pedigrees can sometimes, depending of course on their circumstances prior to coming to you, have accidents or no experience of living in a house. They can arrive stressed after a journey and urinate. It doesn't mean that they will always have these issues or nuances. It's not because of their past. It's the normal transition and the gift of time.</p>

<p>Habits can develop that are environmentally triggered and then they may re-use an area that they have previously used inside. Surgical spirit is the only product that removes any odours to a dogs sense of smell, so it's always worth having a bottle to clean up any accidents. Certainly any habits or problems that arise can be corrected. Often dogs think they are doing the right thing and it's confusing for them. We mean well and don't realise we are reinforcing a belief rather than discouraging it.</p>

<p>For example, one owner didn't take his dog outside immediately on arrival and when she went on a puppy training mat he had laid down he praised her so much that she thought that was what she was meant to do. She's fine now.</p>

<p>As a tip: never shout at a dog if they do something that's unacceptable to you and <strong>in no circumstances</strong> rub their noses in the accident.</p>

<p>These old fashioned approaches are known to be unkind and ineffective. They will make your dogs anxious and compound any behaviour not resolve it.</p>

<p>Training using positive reinforcement methods mentioned earlier when they urinate in your garden, for example, should be introduced by the owner as part of dog ownership (See the Training section for more information).</p>

<p>What I will say is that when owners have followed our guidelines of going straight into a garden we've never had a toilet issue in the 300 dogs I've homed in the previous year.</p>

<p>I'll give you one brief example that will make you smile:<br>
Burton was 15 yrs old when I met him. He had been ten years on a chain and five years in a government pound on concrete outdoors. I found him a young glamorous family with children and on the first day of arriving he went to the door to be let out for a wee. How did he know? He'd never lived in a house!</p>

<p>They are phenomenal and miracle dogs. They are not feral but grateful and clever. One rescue centre commented to an adopter they sent to me that none of their U.K. rescues - interbred etc- could be homed straight to a house and she recommended me as mine can. I say mine- they are their own worlds and miraculous ones that forgive and never lose the desire to belong and be loved.</p>

<p>Remember and spread the word that these dogs have only ever gone outside - it's what they know and they seek that familiar out as long as owners follow my guidance. Of course, there are always going to be some exceptions as mentioned above. Sadly, the instinct and compulsion to toilet outside can be interrupted by owners but we can soon get them back on track.</p>
